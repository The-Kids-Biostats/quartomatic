Description: Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system often employed by 
analysts to organise and report outputs into various formats (HTML, Word, PDF). Often, in 
organisational settings and otherwise, users choose to customise the theming of reports---an area 
which is, in general, non-trivial. The quartomatic package aims to simplify this procedure, allowing 
users to interactively update and customise quarto templates.
