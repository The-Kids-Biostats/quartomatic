Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system
often employed by analysts to organise and report outputs into various
formats (HTML, Word, PDF). Often, in organisational settings and
otherwise, users choose to customise the theming of reports—an area
which is, in general, non-trivial. The quartomatic package aims to
simplify this procedure, allowing users to interactively update and
customise quarto templates.

## Installation

You can install the development version of quartomatic from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

\``r # install.packages("pak") pak::pak("The-Kids-Biostats/quartomatic")`
